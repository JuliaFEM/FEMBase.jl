    "text": "using FEMBaseFrom the beginning of a project we had a clear concept in our mind: \"everything is a field\". That is, everything can vary temporally and spatially. We think that constant is just a special case of field which does not vary in temporal nor spatial direction. Fields can vary in spatial direction, i.e. can be either constant or variable, and in temporal direction, i.e. can be time variant or time invariant. From this pondering we can think that there exists four kind of (discrete) fields:discrete, constant, time invariant (DCTI)\ndiscrete, variable, time invariant (DVTI)\ndiscrete, constant, time variant (DCTV)\ndiscrete, variable, time variant (DVTV)Discrete, in this context, means that field is defined in point-wise in 1 ldots n locations, from where it is then interpolated to whole domain using some interpolation polynomials, i.e. \\begin{equation}     u(\\xi, t) = \\sum_{i} u_i[t] N_{i}(\\xi,t), \\end{equation} where     N_i(xi t) is the basis function or interpolation polymial corresponding to i^{th} discrete value and      u_i is the discrete value.Then we have continuous fields, which are defined in whole domain, or at least not point-wise. By following the already used abbreviations, we have four more fields:continuous, constant, time invariant (CCTI)\ncontinuous, variable, time invariant (CVTI)\ncontinuous, constant, time variant (DCTV)\ncontinuous, variable, time variant (CVTV)Continuous, again in this context, does not mean that field has to be defined everywhere. It's enough that it's defined in function of spatial and/or temporal coordinates, i.e. we have u equiv u(xi t), without a some spesific basis needed to interpolate from discrete values. Field itself can be in principle anything. However, usually either scalar, vector or tensor (matrix). Time does not to have be real, it can be for example angle of some rotating machine or even complex value. From these starting points, we assume that the mentioned field system can describe all imaginable situations."

    "text": "For discrete fields that are varying in spatial direction, value for each discrete point is defined using NTuple. The order of points is implicitly assumed to be same than node ordering in ABAQUS. That is, first corner nodes in anti-clockwise direction and after that middle nodes.For example, (1, 2, 3, 4) is a scalar field having length of 4 and ([1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]) is a vector field having length of 4.For fields that are varying in temporal direction, time => value syntax is used. The first item in pair is time (or similar) and second item is value  assigned to that time. For example, 0.0 => 1.0 is a time-dependent scalar field having value 1.0 at time 0.0.The most simple field is a field that is constant in both time and spatial direction. Discrete, constant, time invariant DCTI:a = DCTI(1.0)Then we have discrete, variable, time invariant fields DVTI. Notice the use of Tuple when defining field.b = DVTI( (1.0, 2.0) )Discrete, constant, time variant field DCTV is constant in spatial direction partial upartial x = 0 but can vary in temporal direction, partial upartial tneq 0. Here, => syntax is used. New values can be added to field using function update!. If there already exists a value for that particular time, it will be overridden. It is assumed that content of field in time direction is monotonically increasing, i.e. \\begin{equation}     t_{i-1} < t_i < t_{i+1}. \\end{equation}For the sake of clarity let's also mention that update! works for time invariant fields as well if content needs to be updated.c = DCTV(0.0 => 1.0, 1.0 => 2.0)\nupdate!(c, 2.0 => 3.0)Discrete, variable, time variant DVTV field is the most general one, allowing values of field to vary in both spatial and time direction.d = DVTV(0.0 => (1.0, 2.0), 1.0 => (2.0, 3.0))\nupdate!(d, 2.0 => (3.0, 4.0))In examples above, all fields defined was scalar fields. Defining vector or tensor fields goes in the same way. The only difference is that now we define vectors and tensors instead of a single scalar value. They can vary in spatial and time direction in the same way than scalar fields. Here is example of defining the abovementioned vector fields:a = DCTI([1.0, 2.0])\nb = DVTI(([1.0, 2.0], [2.0, 3.0]))\nc = DCTV(0.0 => [1.0, 2.0], 1.0 => [2.0, 3.0])\nd = DVTV(0.0 => ([1.0, 2.0], [2.0, 3.0]), 1.0 => ([2.0, 3.0], [3.0, 4.0]))"

    "text": "Accessing fields in time direction is done using a function interpolate. For example, if we have (constant) 12 at time t=00 and 34 at time t=10, linear interpolation in time direction yieldsc = DCTV(0.0 => [1.0,2.0], 1.0 => [3.0,4.0])\ninterpolate(c, 0.5)If field is spatially varying, a Tuple will be returned, having one value for each \"node\". This can then be interpolated in spatial direction, typically using basis functions defined on element, i.e. u = N_i u_i:d = DVTV(0.0 => (1.0,2.0), 1.0 => (3.0,4.0))\ninterpolate(d, 0.5)Although the two fields above looks quite same, the key difference is that in DCTV field we have a constant vectorial value (defined using square brackets []) and in latter DVTV field we have a scalar value (defined using round brackets) changing in spatial direction from 1.0 to 2.0 at time t=00 and changing from 3.0 to 4.0 at time t=10.If a field is time invariant, interpolation in time direction returns a trivial solution:interpolate(DCTI(1.0), 0.5)\ninterpolate(DVTI((1.0,2.0)), 0.5)For spatially varying fields, one can access to ith element using getindex:a = DVTI((1.0,2.0))\ngetindex(a, 1)For field varying both temporally and spatially, one has first to interpolate in time direction to get iterable tuple:d = DVTV(0.0 => (1.0,2.0), 1.0 => (3.0,4.0))\nresult = interpolate(d, 0.5)\ngetindex(result, 1)Internally, each field is a subtype of AbstractField having a field data, which be accessed directly for hacking purposes.d.data"

    "text": "Usually it is assumed that size of length of discrete field matches to the number of basis functions of a single element, typically something small like 1-10.However, there might be cases where it is more practical to define field in a sense that indexing is not continuous or starting from 1. For example, we might want to define field common for a set of elements. In that case it's natural to think that each index in field corresponds to the certain id-number of node. For example, if we have a triangle element connecting nodes 1, 1000 and 100000, we still want to access that field naturally using getindex, e.g. f[1], f[1000] and f[100000]. In that case, more appropriate internal structure for field is based on a dictionary, not tuple.It only makes sense to define dictionary fields for spatially varying fields. Two new fields are introduced: DVTId and DVTVd, where the last character \"d\" stands for \"dictionary\".Keep on mind, that this type of field has one restriction. If and when this field is typically defined on nodes of several elements, field must be continuous between elements. That is, if field value in node 1000 is for example 1.0, then it's 1.0 in all elements connecting to that node. To define jumps on field, one must define field element-wise. Define eg. \"geometry\" for nodes 1,1000,100000:X = Dict(1=>[0.0,0.0], 1000=>[1.0,0.0], 100000=>[1.0,1.0])\nG = DVTId(X)\nG[1], G[1000], G[100000]Interpolation in time directions works in a same way than with other fields depends from time.Y = Dict(1=>[1.0,1.0], 1000=>[2.0,1.0], 100000=>[2.0,2.0])\nF = DVTVd(0.0 => X, 1.0 => Y)\ninterpolate(F,0.5)[100000]"

As a result, we have a new basis MyQuad, working just like expected. All Lagrange polynomials are done like this.B = MyQuad()\nxi = (0.5, 0.5)\neval_basis!(B, N, xi)In this case, and considering domain, partial derivatives of shape functions are with respect to X, because interpolation polynomials are calculated against real domain and not \"reference domain\". That is, partial derivatives should match to what already calcualated.eval_dbasis!(B, dN, xi)Jacobian should be identity matrix:J = jacobian(B, X, xi)And taking gradient with respect to X should return also same result than before:u = ([0.0, 0.0], [1.0, -1.0], [2.0, 3.0], [0.0, 0.0])\ngrad(B, u, X, xi)Shape functions can be defined manually and calculate partial derivatives automatically. For example, for pyramid elements typical ansatz approach is not applicable. Some other degenerated elements exists in fracture mechanics.For example, C1-continuous Hermite shape functions ready to approximate Euler-Bernoulli beam equations can be defined as:code = create_basis(\n    :C1Hermite,\n    \"C1-continuous Hermite shape functions\",\n    (\n        (0.0,),\n        (0.0,),\n        (1.0,),\n        (1.0,)\n    ),\n    (\n        \"2*u^3 - 3*u^2 + 1\",\n        \"u^3 - 2*u^2 + u\",\n        \"-2*u^3 + 3*u^2\",\n        \"u^3 - u^2\"\n    )\n);\neval(code)Again, we should have 1.0 in corresponding nodal point or it's derivative, according to that order we have u(0) u(0) u(1) u(1), soB = C1Hermite()\nN = zeros(1, 4)\ndN = zeros(1, 4)\neval_basis!(B, N, (0.0,))\neval_dbasis!(B, dN, (0.0,))\neval_basis!(B, N, (1.0,))\neval_dbasis!(B, dN, (1.0,))The last option is to build everything from scratch. For that, one must import and define following functions:Base.size\nBase.length\nFEMBase.get_reference_element_coordinates\nFEMBase.eval_basis!\nFEMBase.eval_dbasis!As an examples, a simple implementation of P-hierarchical 1d-basis would then be the following:import Base: size, length\nimport FEMBase: get_reference_element_coordinates,\n                eval_basis!, eval_dbasis!,\n                AbstractBasis\n\ntype PSeg <: AbstractBasis\n    order :: Int\nend\n\nfunction PSeg()\n    return PSeg(1)\nend\n\nfunction length(basis::PSeg)\n    return basis.order+1\nend\n\nfunction size(basis::PSeg)\n    return (1, basis.order+1)\nend\n\nfunction get_reference_element_coordinates(basis::PSeg)\n    return ((-1.0,), (1.0,))\nend\n\nnothing # hideNext, define Legengre polynomials:\"\"\"\n    get_legendre_polynomial(n)\n\nReturn Legendgre polynomial of order `n` to inverval ξ ∈ [1, 1].\n\nImplementation uses Bonnet's recursion formula.

    "text": "In JuliaFEM, elements can be considered as \"containers\", combining fields and basis functions described above. Among that, element has information about topology (connectivity) and numerical integration rule. These fundamentals forms a finite element, the backbone of finite element method.using FEMBaseNew elements are constructed by passing basis type (e.g. Seg2, Quad4, Tet10, ...) to Element and list of id numbers to where element is topologically connected.el = Element(Quad4, [1, 2, 3, 4])Setting fields to element is done using a command update!, which either creates a new field if field with that name does not already exist, or updates the old one. Typically, at least field called geometry needs to be defined to element as it's used to calculate Jacobian of element. Fields can be discrete, continuous, time invariant or variant, variable or constant, or anything else that is subclassed from AbstractField.X = Dict(1 => [0.0,0.0], 2=>[1.0,0.0], 3=>[1.0,1.0], 4=>[0.0,1.0])\nupdate!(el, \"geometry\", X)Internally, fields are stored in a Dict:el.fieldsThe command update! is automatically inspecting field type based in input. For example, to define temporal field varying spatially:u0 = ([0.0,0.0], [0.0,0.0], [0.0,0.0], [0.0,0.0])\nu1 = ([0.0,0.0], [0.0,0.0], [0.5,0.0], [0.0,0.0])\nupdate!(el, \"displacement\", 0.0 => u0)\nupdate!(el, \"displacement\", 1.0 => u1)\nel.fieldsInterpolating of fields can be done using syntax Element(field_name, xi, time). For example, position of material particle X in initial configuration and deformed configuration in the middle of the element at time t=1 can be found asxi = (0.0, 0.0)\ntime = 1.0\nX = el(\"geometry\", xi, time)\nu = el(\"displacement\", xi, time)\nx = X+uJacobian, determinant of Jacobian and gradient of field can be calculated adding extra argument Val{:Jacobian}, Val{:detJ}, Val{:Grad} to the above command and not passing field name, i.e.el(xi, time, Val{:Jacobian})\nel(xi, time, Val{:detJ})\nel(xi, time, Val{:Grad})Usually what is needed when calculating local stiffness matrices is a gradient of some field. For example, displacement gradient and temperature gradient can be obtained following way:gradu = el(\"displacement\", xi, time, Val{:Grad})\nupdate!(el, \"temperature\", (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0))\ngradT = el(\"temperature\", xi, time, Val{:Grad})Accessing integration points of element is done using function get_integration_points. Combining interpolation and integration one can already calculate local matrices of a single element or, for example area and strain energy:update!(el, \"lambda\", 96.0)\nupdate!(el, \"mu\", 48.0)\n\nA = 0.0\nW = 0.0\nfor ip in get_integration_points(el)\n    detJ = el(ip, time, Val{:detJ})\n    A += ip.weight * detJ\n    ∇u = el(\"displacement\", ip, time, Val{:Grad})\n    E = 1/2*(∇u + ∇u')\n    λ = el(\"lambda\", ip, time)\n    μ = el(\"mu\", ip, time)\n    W += ip.weight * ( λ/2*trace(E*E') + μ*trace(E)^2) * detJ\nend\n\nprintln(\"Area: $A\")\nprintln(\"Strain energy: $W\")To calculate local stiffness matrix for Poisson problem:K = zeros(4,4)\nupdate!(el, \"coefficient\", 36.0)\nfor ip in get_integration_points(el)\n    dN = el(ip, time, Val{:Grad})\n    detJ = el(ip, time, Val{:detJ})\n    c = el(\"coefficient\", ip, time)\n    K += ip.weight * c*dN'*dN * detJ\nend\nKFor more memory efficient code it's a good idea to use BasisInfo and element_info! which allocates working memory to calculate all \"basic stuff\" for a single integration point, like Jacobian, determinant of Jacobian, basis and it's partial derivatives with respect to reference configuration X.bi = BasisInfo(Quad4)\nfill!(K, 0.0)\nfor ip in get_integration_points(el)\n    J, detJ, N, dN = element_info!(bi, el, ip, time)\n    c = el(\"coefficient\", ip, time)\n    K += ip.weight * c*dN'*dN * detJ\nend\nK"

Ke is used to store local stiffness matrix. Then iterate over all elements and integration points, evaluate basis and add contribution to local stiffness matrix. Finally, get global degrees of freedom for element by using command get_gdofs and finally add contribution to global stiffness matrix K.From performance point of view, it's important that memory allocations inside at least the innermost loop is minimized, although assembling global stiffness matrix can be parallelized (at least almost) perfectly and is not considered as a bottleneck when models get big enough. It's anyway a good idea to pay attention to the memory allocations.Let's create some test problem and test our implementation:el1 = Element(Quad4, [1, 2, 3, 4])\nX = Dict(1 => [0.0,0.0], 2 => [1.0,0.0], 3 => [1.0,1.0], 4 => [0.0,1.0])\nupdate!(el1, \"geometry\", X)\nupdate!(el1, \"thermal conductivity\", 6.0)\nelements = [el1]\nassembly = Assembly()\nproblem = Problem(Heat, \"test problem\", 1)Now the struct Heat is empty. If we need to store some problem-wide settings to that struct, they can be found from problem.properties. When creating a new Problem, the syntax is Problem(type, name, field_dimension), where two first arguments are self descriptive. The third one is the information, how many degrees of freedom is in this problem. As Poisson problem is scalar equation, there is only 1 degrees of freedom per node. For example in continuum mechanics, where the unknown field is displacement, there is usually 2-6 degrees of freedom per node, depending on problem type. Next we do the actual assembling of elements into global stiffness matrix:time = 0.0\nassemble_elements!(problem, assembly, elements, time)full(assembly.K)There is actually one Assembly inside Problem and elements are defined to problem using add_elements!, so a more realistic use case to create global assembly would be to use assemble!(problem, time) as shown below:el2 = Element(Tri3, [3, 2, 5])\nX[5] = [2.0, 1.0]\nelements = [el1, el2]\nupdate!(elements, \"geometry\", X)\nupdate!(elements, \"thermal conductivity\", 6.0)\nproblem = Problem(Heat, \"test problem\", 1)\nadd_elements!(problem, elements)\nassemble!(problem, time)full(problem.assembly.K)Now, function defined above is actually executed two times, first for elements using Tri3 basis and after that for Quad4. That is, assemble!(problem, time) is grouping elements by their type and calling function for each element type separately. It also does some initializations and gives possibility to mangle matrices before and after assembly. These hacks may be useful if one needs to add some discrete values to the matrices after assembly or e.g. save matrices to disk for later diagnoses.We also need to deal with the integrals on the right hand side. The first integral is done over the domain and can be included to the same assemble_elements!-function than stiffness matrix. Boundary term can be handled in different ways. One option is to define it yet in same function and search for fields like surface traction S1, where S1 is one side of the element. This is how it is done in ABAQUS. Another way is to use lower dimensional \"boundary element\" in assembly and add surface term to that element. This is how it is done in Code Aster.assembly_elements!-function defined above can be overridden by restricting the type of elements list, elements::Vector{Element{B}} to a some spesific elements. This allows, for example, to optimize assembly for some certain element type what is commonly used. Another use case is to define different assembly function for boundary elements. In 2d setting, voluminal elements like Tet3, Tet6, Quad4, Quad8, Quad9 are integrated over volume and they one dimensional counterparts Seg2, Seg3 can be used to assign boundary fluxes.The updated assemble_elements!-function, which can also handle volume load from right hand side of the equation, i.e. int fvmathrmdxlooks like following:function assemble_elements!{B}(problem::Problem{Heat}, assembly::Assembly,\n                               elements::Vector{Element{B}}, time::Float64)\n\n    println(\"Assembling volume elements of kind $B\")\n    bi = BasisInfo(B)\n    ndofs = length(B)\n    Ke = zeros(ndofs, ndofs)\n    fe = zeros(ndofs)\n\n    for element in elements\n        fill!(Ke, 0.0)\n        fill!(fe, 0.0)\n        for ip in get_integration_points(element)\n            J, detJ, N, dN = element_info!(bi, element, ip, time)\n            k = element(\"thermal conductivity\", ip, time)\n            Ke += ip.weight * k*dN'*dN * detJ\n            if haskey(element, \"heat source\")\n                f = element(\"heat source\", ip, time)\n                fe += ip.weight * N'*f * detJ\n            end\n        end\n        gdofs = get_gdofs(problem, element)\n        add!(assembly.K, gdofs, gdofs, Ke)\n        add!(assembly.f, gdofs, fe)\n    end\n\nend\n\nnothing # hideAt last, implement boundary elements to handle heat flux.

As the plan is to develop a multiphysical FEM platform, it's a hard question how to create this kind of mapping in a dynamic way. Yet another question is how to set boundary conditions for different type of physics. For now, these questions are answered by defining the name of unknown field using function get_unknown_field_name and giving the dimension of unknown field when creating a problem, so that change of information between two problem is possible. This solution has already identified shortcomings and can be expected to change in future.function get_unknown_field_name(::Problem{Heat})\n    return \"temperature\"\nend\n\nnothing # hidetype DirichletBC <: BoundaryProblem\nendOur implementation to handle boundary condition u = u_0 looks following:function assemble_elements!{E}(problem::Problem{DirichletBC},\n                               assembly::Assembly,\n                               elements::Vector{Element{E}},\n                               time::Float64)\n\n    name = get_parent_field_name(problem)\n    dim = get_unknown_field_dimension(problem)\n\n    println(\"Assembling Dirichlet boundary condition\")\n    println(\"Field name = $name, dofs/node = $dim\")\n\n    data = Dict{Int64,Float64}()\n    for element in elements\n        for i=1:dim\n            haskey(element, \"$name $dim\") || continue\n            gdofs = get_gdofs(problem, element)\n            ldofs = gdofs[i:dim:end]\n            xis = get_reference_element_coordinates(E)\n            for (ldof, xi) in zip(ldofs, xis)\n                data[ldof] = interpolate(element, \"$name $dim\", xi, time)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    for (dof, val) in data\n        add!(assembly.C1, dof, dof, 1.0)\n        add!(assembly.C2, dof, dof, 1.0)\n        add!(assembly.g, dof, val)\n    end\n\nendTo fix dofs 1 and 4 like before:bel1 = Element(Seg2, [1, 4])\nupdate!(bel1, \"geometry\", X)\nupdate!(bel1, \"temperature 1\", 0.0)\nbc = Problem(DirichletBC, \"fixed\", 1, \"temperature\")\nadd_elements!(bc, [bel1])\nassemble!(bc, time)Now we have all matrices needed:C1 = full(bc.assembly.C1, 5, 5)\nC2 = full(bc.assembly.C2, 5, 5)\nD = full(bc.assembly.D, 5, 5)\ng = full(bc.assembly.g, 5, 1)Together with already calculated matrices, we can now form saddle point problem boldsymbolAboldsymbolx = boldsymbolb:A = [K C1; C2 D]\nb = [f; g]Solution:nz = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]\nx = zeros(10)\nx[nz] = A[nz,nz] \\ b[nz]As a result we have found boldsymbolu and boldsymbollambda:u = x[1:5]\nla = x[6:10]\nu' * laBoth field problem and boundary problems can of course have all four matrices and two vectors. For example, in finite sliding contact algorithms all four matrices are used as algorithms are contributing to stiffness matrix also when linearized properly."
