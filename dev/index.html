It implements all the basic data structures in an efficient way and aims to be the rock-solid backbone which can be used to build your very own FEM solver. The basis principle is that FEMBase is a tiny and well-optimized, efficient subset of larger finite element method software with pre- and postprocessors. FEMBase.jl is used in JuliaFEM.jl.</p><p>In order to make a stable package, all operations that are not closely related to the basic operations are left out. This encourages to develop a highly modular FEM where features are implemented in their own packages. The stragegy chosen is intentional. Pre- and posprocessing, physical models, file formats and things like that evolve in time, while the basic principles stay. We want that those evolving things stay in their own packages as much as possible.</p><h2 id="What-FEMBase.jl-does-1"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-FEMBase.jl-does-1">What FEMBase.jl does</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-FEMBase.jl-does-1" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>FEMBase implements all kind of basic data types like <code>Problem</code>, <code>Element</code>, <code>Node</code>, <code>IntegrationPoint</code>, <code>Analysis</code> and so on so that user can define the discretized geometry and integration scheme. Each element does have a topology like <code>Poi1</code>, <code>Seg2</code>, <code>Tri3</code>, <code>Quad4</code>, <code>Tet4</code>, <code>Hex8</code> for isoparametric linear elements having only corner nodes or <code>Seg3</code>, <code>Tri6</code>, <code>Quad8</code>, <code>Tet10</code>, <code>Hex20</code> for isoparametric quadratic elements having nodes in middle of the edges. Then there is also elements having middle nodes like <code>Tri7</code> and <code>Quad9</code>.</p><p>Data of model is repsented in fields. Data type can be scalar, vector, tensor or something user-defined for spesific needs. Data can be defined in analysis, problem, element, node or integration point. Data can depend on time and it can be interpolated with respect to time using different interpolation schemes.</p><p>Data can also be interpolated in spatial direction using basis functions, which are Lagrange basis functions at the moment.</p><h2 id="What-FEMBase.jl-doesn&#39;t-do-1"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-FEMBase.jl-doesn&#39;t-do-1">What FEMBase.jl doesn&#39;t do</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-FEMBase.jl-doesn&#39;t-do-1" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>FEMBase.jl doesn&#39;t solve the system of equations. You can define model and data, integrate and interpolate, but you need to write your own solver. And as a consequence it doesn&#39;t write the results to anywhere, so you need to implement your own results writer or use some of the existing solutions like <code>XdmfWriter.jl</code>.</p><p>FEMBase.jl doesn&#39;t have any physical models. FEMBase doesn&#39;t know anything about displacements, temperatures, velocities or pressures. FEMBase.jl does assemble a problem, but it doesn&#39;t define it. So you need to build your physical model in some other package or use some of the existing solutions like <code>HeatTransfer.jl</code>. Things related to geometry, like calculating Jacobians, are supported.</p><p>FEMBase does not parse mesh from other format. For that, you need to implement your own parser or use some existing solutions, like <code>AbaqusReader.jl</code>, <code>AsterReader.jl</code> or <code>Gmsh.jl</code>.</p><h2 id="What-FEMBase.jl-is-planning-to-do-1"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-FEMBase.jl-is-planning-to-do-1">What FEMBase.jl is planning to do</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-FEMBase.jl-is-planning-to-do-1" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Given data and basis functions, we should be able to naturally interpolate any kind of data. In current implementation, we have an assumption that data is defined in nodes like it is done standard FE methods. Then we have things like hierarchical elements, NURBS, material particle method and so on, which should also be possible to implement using FEMBase.</p><h2 id="Nomenclature-1"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Nomenclature-1">Nomenclature</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Nomenclature-1" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>In this package, the roof concept is analysis, which can mean any kind of action done given a set of problems. We analyze a problem. Analysis can be, for example, integrating the volume of some area, calculating the pressure, temperature or displacement of some volume, calculating it&#39;s eigenvalues or things like that. In even highler level, a simulation is a sequence of analyses performed in order to achieve of final deliverable. In commercial softwares, analysis would resemble maybe like &quot;STEP&quot; in ABAQUS.</p><p>The subject of analysis doesn&#39;t have to be anything what we physically observe, like a solid volume. In abstract sense, it&#39;s just a set of problems to where we apply a series of actions. At this level of abstraction, we don&#39;t care about the internal structure of the problem. So what are then the problems?</p><p>Each analysis is having a set of problems. There can be only one or there can be several. One could think &quot;problem&quot; something equivalent to &quot;body&quot; in some other FEM codes, or something similar, byt it&#39;s not physically restricted in any manner. Problem describes the physics, what is considered to be solved. The reason why problems are not called to bodies in FEMBase is the following: not all problems relates to the volume.</p><p>For example, when elastic bodies are having surface interactions, it&#39;s called to contact problem, and the problem can be fully described just by knowing the boundary / surface of the bodies. In the final discretized system, we do not need any information about the internal structure of the volume. Thus it would be unnecessary complication to carry all that data with the problem.</p><p>In problem level, we need to start thinking about how we describe it. In the context of finite elements, we are describing the problem with the help of finite elements. And in this level, we need to take care of our solution strategy. Discretized problem has to be somehow transferred to something what linear system solver understands. So, the problem is kind of &quot;element set&quot;. Problem have a matrix level representation and elements describing the problem. This is the level where new physical rules are applied. Given a set of elements, populate the matrices ready for solver.</p><p>For this, we need to have some mapping, which connect each element local degrees of freedom to the global ones.</p><p>The element itself is an individual entity. It doesn&#39;t need anything surrounding complexity to fully describe it&#39;s own state. It can be connected to problem, but it&#39;s not mandatory. Element is having it&#39;s own topology, basis functions and fields. Element doesn&#39;t even need a connection information to other elements. Element needs to know only it&#39;s own geometry. Given basis and data, element can interpolate its results in the geometrical domain occupied by that element. Element can form it own local matrices. Your own one element FEM should be possible to do just by using <code>Element</code>, without any complexities.</p><p>When doing FEM, we also need to integrate, which is done numerically using some discrete integration scheme. Thus we need integation points. They are defined inside elements.</p><pre><code class="language-none">analysis -&gt; problems -&gt; elements -&gt; integration points</code></pre><p>In this description, we did go in top-down-approach. This same setup should also make sense when going in other direction.</p><h2 id="Outline-1"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Outline-1">Outline</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Outline-1" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>This documentation aims to describe the structures of the package in &quot;bottom to up&quot; manner. starting from the smaller data types proceeding to the big scope.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="fields/">Fields »</a></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> on <span class="colophon-date" title="Monday 4 May 2020 14:03">Monday 4 May 2020</span>.
